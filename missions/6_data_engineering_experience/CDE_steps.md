### Create a CDE virtual cluster

### Create/run a job
https://docs.cloudera.com/data-engineering/cloud/manage-jobs/topics/cde-create-job.html

Upload your python script from Mission 4....sort of.  My script used some hive pieces to create an external table.  I removed those pieces since my Datahub cluster had been spun down, and thus had no hiveserver to run those pieces against.


Run the job.

I did not need to supply any additional configurations, jars, or anything other than my python script.
