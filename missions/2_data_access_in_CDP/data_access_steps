There were some steps around adding users & creating admin groups, syncing users, sync users to FreeIPA....I missed documenting those steps.  



hdfs dfs -ls s3a://cnelson2-data/external/

echo "hello world" > text.txt

hdfs dfs -put test.txt s3a://cnelson2-data/external/test.txt
hdfs dfs -ls s3a://cnelson2-data/external/
hdfs dfs -rm -skipTrash s3a://cnelson2-data/external/

You must use skipTrash or else it will fail.
